skylab-station-viewed-by-skylab-2-command-module_9456593435_o.jpg Skylab Station Viewed by Skylab 2 Command Module: A view of the Skylab 1 space station Orbital Workshop showing the micrometeoroid shield missing. A parasol solar shield was later deployed to shade this exposed area. This picture was taken from the Skylab 2 Command/Service Module during its "fly around" inspection. The Apollo Telescope Mount is in the background. The damaged and partially deployed OWS solar array system wing is at lower right. After an aluminum strapping was cut during the June 7th extravehicular activity, the solar panel fully deployed. The OWS solar panel on the opposite side was completely ripped off during the Skylab 1 launch on May 14th leaving only cables and tubing. (NASA on The Commons)
